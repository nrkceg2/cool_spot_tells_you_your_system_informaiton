# Cool Spot tells you your System Information.
the repo name says it all.
# Why?
I needed something to do in my free time, and found out about Tkinter.
# How to use:
* Open it.
* Stare at your system information.
# FAQ
* Why no GPU?
  * Because neither os or platform modules allow for GPU things (as far as I know.)
      * I made this on my school laptop, so I cannot use pip.
* Why Cool Spot?
  * Because I thought it'd be funny, and I needed a image to test tkinter with.
* It doesn't work correctly on my system!
  * Sorry for not ensuring compatibility for something meant fully as a joke.
  * No seriously, I am. I made this on Windows 11 Education, without any testing on other platforms as of writing, so sorry for not getting it to work right on your system.
